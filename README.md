# 🎵 just_vibing

A personal playground for experimenting, tinkering, and learning.  
This repo doesn’t follow strict rules — it’s just a space to **explore fun projects** on my own and see where curiosity leads. ✨

---

## 🌟 Purpose
- Try out new technologies, frameworks, and ideas
- Build quick prototypes or proof-of-concepts
- Practice coding skills in a low-pressure environment
- Keep track of “just vibing” side projects

---

## 📂 Repo Structure
The repo might include:
- `notebooks/` → experiments, tutorials, or analysis notebooks
- `scripts/` → small utilities or throwaway code snippets
- `projects/` → bigger explorations that deserve their own folder
- `docs/` → notes, diagrams, or ideas

*(Structure may evolve as I vibe with new projects.)*
